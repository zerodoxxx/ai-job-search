# Job Scraper

---

## How It Works

This skill searches job portals using the **installed portal-search CLIs** in
`.agents/skills/` (plus WebSearch as a fallback or for portals without CLIs like Naukri, Foundit, etc.), using queries from your profile.
It deduplicates against previously seen jobs and the application tracker, and
presents new matches with a quick fit assessment.

## Invocation

The user triggers this skill by saying things like:
- "Find new jobs"
- "Scrape for jobs"
- "Any new positions?"
- "/scrape"

Optional arguments:
- A focus area, e.g. "/scrape data science" or "/scrape data engineering"
- "broad" to run all search categories, e.g. "/scrape broad"
- "health" to run the portal health check only (Step 4.75), without searching, deduplicating, or presenting jobs - e.g. "/scrape health", or "/scrape health jobnet" to probe one portal even if disabled

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Load State

1. Read `job_scraper/seen_jobs.json` (create if missing - start with `{"seen": {}}`)
2. Read `job_search_tracker.csv` to extract already-applied companies+roles
3. Read `search-queries.md` (this directory) for the search strategy

### Step 1: Search

Read `search-queries.md` (this directory) for the search strategy. By default, run the top 3 priority query categories. If the user said "broad", run all categories. If the user specified a focus area (e.g. "data science"), prioritize queries from that category.

**Use the installed CLI tools as the primary search mechanism.** Fall back to `WebSearch` only for portals that do not have a CLI skill (e.g. Naukri, Foundit, Shine, TimesJobs, Instahyre), or if `bun` is unavailable on the system.

#### 1a. Check bun availability

```bash
bun --version
```

If this fails (bun not installed), skip to **1c (WebSearch fallback)** for all portals and note the fallback in the Step 5 output.

#### 1b. Run CLI tools (primary — run these in parallel where possible)

Discover all installed portal CLI skills by reading every `SKILL.md` found under `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`. Each file documents that portal's exact CLI flags and usage examples. **Use each portal's own documented interface — do not guess flags.** This approach automatically includes any new portals added via `/add-portal` without requiring changes to this file.

**Honor the `enabled` toggle.** A portal is enabled unless its `SKILL.md` frontmatter sets `enabled: false` (a missing key means enabled — the default). Skip each disabled portal and record it for the Step 5 summary. A fork can thus keep a portal installed but sit out a run without deleting its directory.

For each **enabled** portal skill:

1. Read its `SKILL.md` to find the correct `bun run …` invocation and supported flags.
2. Translate the query terms from `search-queries.md` into that portal's flag format (e.g. `--key`, `--search-string`, `--query`, filter codes — whatever the portal's SKILL.md specifies).
3. Scope to the last 14 days using the portal's supported recency **filter** flag (`--jobage`, `--since <YYYY-MM-DD>`, etc. — as documented per portal). A portal with **no recency flag** still gets scoped: every portal's search output carries a `date` field, so filter client-side — drop results whose `date` is older than 14 days after the call returns.
4. Cap results to ~20 per call using the portal's limit flag.
5. Use `--format json` for machine-readable output.

Run all portal CLI calls in parallel where possible. Collect all `results` arrays into a single pool for Step 2, keeping each result tagged with its source portal skill.

If a CLI tool exits with a non-zero code, log the error message and continue — do not abort the whole search.

#### 1c. WebSearch fallback

Use `WebSearch` for:
- Portals listed in `search-queries.md` that do **not** have a corresponding directory under `.agents/skills/` (such as `site:naukri.com`, `site:foundit.in`, `site:shine.com`, etc.)
- Any portal whose CLI fails at runtime
- When bun is unavailable (Step 1a failed)

Use the site-specific query strings from `search-queries.md` directly as WebSearch queries for these portals.

Tag each fallback result as WebSearch-sourced, keeping the portal tag when the fallback stands in for an installed portal whose CLI failed. Step 4 persists this as the entry's `source`, and Step 5 reports which portals ran on the fallback this run.

### Step 2: Fetch & Parse

For each promising result from Step 1:

**From CLI results:** Search output already includes title, company, location, date,
and URL. For jobs worth a deeper look, fetch full detail with that portal's `detail`
command (see its SKILL.md — do not guess flags) to extract **key requirements**,
**application deadline**, and a brief description snippet.

**From WebSearch results:** Use `WebFetch` on the posting URL and extract the same
fields manually. If it returns HTTP 403 (e.g. on blocked Indian portals like Naukri), retry with browser headers via curl per
`.agents/skills/job-application-assistant/09-web-research.md` before falling back to search snippet metadata. Never guess or invent requirements/deadlines.

**Store a URL that actually resolves to the posting.** A listing-page URL with a
`#fragment` appended (`.../jobs/ciso/#ikerian`) is not a posting: it fetches fine and
returns unrelated job titles, which makes every later `/rank` and `/apply` run fail on
that entry. When WebSearch only yields a listing page, search the employer's own careers
site for the role and store that URL instead, or drop the candidate rather than saving a
fragment link.

For every candidate:
- Skip if the URL or company+title combo already exists in `seen_jobs.json`
- Skip if the company+role already appears in `job_search_tracker.csv`

### Step 2.5: Mass-Posting Detection (within this run)

If two or more results in this run's pool (from the same company, or sharing the same req/job ID visible in the URL or title) have substantially the same description and differ only in city/location/title, don't present them as separate rows. Consolidate into a single row and note the spread, e.g. "posted identically across 6 cities".

### Step 3: Quick Fit Assessment

For each new job, do a rapid fit check (NOT the full evaluation from `04-job-evaluation.md` - just a quick signal):

- **High match**: Role directly involves your core skills
- **Medium match**: Role is adjacent to your experience
- **Low match**: Role requires significant skills you lack

**Language override:** before assigning a match level, check the posting against `04-job-evaluation.md`'s Language Gate (a required language you haven't declared at all in your AGENTS.md Languages table). A required language that's entirely undeclared overrides skill fit: mark it **Low** regardless of how well the skills align, and name it in the highlight bullets so it isn't buried under an otherwise-good-looking match. A **declared** language at a requirement that reads higher than your declared level is *not* an override — score fit normally, but add a red-flag bullet under that job's highlights (Step 5) quoting the posting's requirement next to your declared level.

### Step 4: Deduplicate & Store

1. Add ALL fetched jobs (new and skipped) to `seen_jobs.json` with structure:
```json
{
  "seen": {
    "<url_or_company_title_key>": {
      "title": "...",
      "company": "...",
      "url": "...",
      "location": "...",
      "first_seen": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "deadline": "YYYY-MM-DD" | null,
      "fit": "high/medium/low",
      "status": "new/skipped/ranked/expired",
      "portal": "<source portal skill, e.g. jobindex-search>",
      "source": "cli/websearch"
    }
  }
}
```

The `portal` field records which CLI skill produced the job.
The `source` field records which mechanism produced the entry (`cli` or `websearch`).

`/rank` extends this schema additively: ranked entries also carry `rank_score` (0–100 overall score), `rank_verdict` (fit band, e.g. "strong fit"), `rank_date` (ISO date of ranking), the veto fields `location_verdict` and `language_gate` (both PASS/FAIL/FLAG) with `language_note` (the quoted requirement explaining a non-PASS), and `strengths`/`gaps` (1-3 verbatim bullets each). The `status` field is set to `"ranked"`. Do not drop any of these fields when re-writing entries.

`deadline` is a base field: Step 2's detail fetch extracts the application deadline, so it is written when the job is first seen and refreshed by `/rank` Step 4 when a scoring agent returns a different value. `null` means the posting states no deadline.

2. Only present jobs NOT already in the seen list or tracker.

### Step 4.5: Generate Referral Contact Links (High & Medium Fit Only)

For every job from this run with `fit` of **high** or **medium** (skip low-fit jobs),
build two LinkedIn people-search URLs so the user can find a recruiter or team member to
reach out to for a referral or a warm intro:

**A. Recruiters / Talent Acquisition (the referral path)**
```
https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=<url-encoded "<Company Name> recruiter">&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER
```

**B. Role/team peers (informational-outreach / warm-intro path)**
```
https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=<url-encoded "<Company Name> <role keyword>">&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER
```

### Step 4.75: Portal Health Check

- **Degraded scan:** inspect results. Flags: `company` null on all results, empty titles, undecoded entities (`&amp;`).
- **Yield history:** check if a previously productive portal produced 0 results.
- **Probe-only mode (`/scrape health`):** probe installed portals directly and report status.

### Step 5: Present Results

Present new jobs in a table sorted by fit (high first), with **Remote roles presented first** within each fit tier.

```
## New Job Matches - YYYY-MM-DD

Found X new positions (Y high, Z medium, W low match).

| # | Fit | Title | Company | Location | Deadline | URL |
|---|-----|-------|---------|----------|----------|-----|
| 1 | High | ... | ... | ... | ... | [Link](...) |

### High-Match Highlights
For each high-match job, add 2-3 bullet points:
- Why it matches your profile
- Key requirements to check
- Any red flags

### Contacts
For each high/medium-fit job from Step 4.5, add a short contacts block with the two LinkedIn search links:
- Recruiters/TA search link
- Role/team-peer search link
```

After presenting, ask:
> "Want me to evaluate any of these in detail? Just give me the number(s)."

### Step 6: Update Tracker (Optional)

If the user decides to apply, the tracker row is written by **job-application-assistant Step 3b** / `/apply`.

---

## Important Rules

1. **Never fabricate job postings.** Only present jobs from actual CLI search/detail output or WebSearch/WebFetch results.
2. **Respect deduplication.** Always check seen_jobs.json AND job_search_tracker.csv before presenting.
3. **Focus on configured locations.** Remote roles are always in scope and come first; on-site jobs must match configured locations.
4. **Only open positions.** Skip postings with expired deadlines or those marked as closed.
5. **Be efficient with detail fetches.** Pre-filter by title/snippet, then fetch only promising matches.
6. **Parallel searches.** Run portal CLI searches in parallel; use WebSearch for portals without CLIs or gaps.
7. **No automated people lookups.** Referral contacts (Step 4.5) are LinkedIn search links only.
8. **Health checks are bounded and honest.**
9. **Flag distribution patterns, never accuse.**
